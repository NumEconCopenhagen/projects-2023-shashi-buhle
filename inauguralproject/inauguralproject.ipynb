Additionally, we must also set constraints on our variables to restrict our set of solutions to be within (0,24) given the layout of the model parameters. We include an arbitrary initial guess that we then include in our optimize.minimize command that is used to minimize the negative of our value_of_choice function subject to our set constraints and bounds.
